# GPT Search

This program combines the power of GPT with DuckDuckGo search results to answer
questions. It fetches relevant information from the web, shortens and summarizes
it, and then uses GPT to generate a response to the user's question.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenAI API Key
- BeautifulSoup
- requests
- tiktoken

## Installation

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install duckduckgo-search openai beautifulsoup4 requests joblib tiktoken
```

## Usage

To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
./gpt_search.py [options] <question>
```

Options:

- `--4` or `-4`: Use GPT-4 model (slower, costs more money).
- `--verbose` or `-v`: Enable verbose output.

Replace `<question>` with the question you want to ask.

## Example

```bash
./gpt_search.py --verbose "What is the process of photosynthesis?"
```

## Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.

## Notes

Please be aware that this program can perform up to 5 GPT queries, which may have associated costs.

ChatGPT, the AI language model developed by OpenAI, has been making waves in the tech world with its advanced capabilities. As previously reported, ChatGPT released experimental AI plugins on March 23, 2023, which allowed the AI to access portions of the internet and provided added functionality for its users.

Recently, OpenAI announced its most advanced language model yet, GPT-4, which is currently only available in the ChatGPT Plus paid subscription and as an API for developers. Companies such as Duolingo, Be My Eyes, Stripe, and Khan Academy have already integrated GPT-4 into their applications and services.

One notable feature of GPT-4 is its ability to process up to 25,000 words of text from the user and receive images as a basis for interaction. It is also more advanced in creativity, visual input, and longer context, making it significantly safer to use than its predecessor.

However, not all experts are on board with the rapid development of GPT-4 and future models. Over 1,000 AI experts have signed an open letter calling on developers to slow down on the development of GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 due to potential large-scale risks.

Nonetheless, developers claim that GPT-5 will complete its training this year and could bring an AI revolution with it. As for ChatGPT, users can expect even more advancements and features to make their interactions with the AI even more seamless and beneficial.
